Page 79: An alternate version of the calculator program uses getline to
read an entire input line which makes getch and ungetch unnecessary. Revise
the calculator to use this approach.

Note: I am breaking the program up into multiple files as shown later in
the book on page 82.

Compile with... gcc calc.h getop.c main.c stack.c -lm
