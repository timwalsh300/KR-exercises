Page 118: Write a program which prints the last n lines of its input. By
default, n is 10, let us say, but can be changed by an optional argument,
so that the command line argument -n prints the last n lines. The program
should behave rationally no matter how unreasonable the input or the value
of n. Write the program so it makes the best use of available storage. Lines
should be stored as in exercise 5-7.

compile with... gcc main.c lines.c alloc.c mygetline.c
