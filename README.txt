These are my solutions to the exercises in the book "The C Programming Language," Second Edition, by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. I developed all of my solutions on an 
Arch Linux machine using nano and gcc version 6.1.1. I do not guarantee that any of my solutions are optimal or even 100% correct. This is just a way for me as an aspiring 
programmer to start really learning C.
